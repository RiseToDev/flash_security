		The program demonstrates our ideas in a field of general security. 
 	"Flash security" program was developed to upend the hardware that provided on the Flash drive. 
 	The point is to improve hardware security by the software. By that, it means the program level 
 	encryption and also decryption files. In idea, only this program can give access to the Flash 
 	drive and operate with it (collaborate  with files and the most important: encrypt and decrypt them).
 	Intending to develop specialized device for store and transferring  different rypes of data. The 
 	hardware security that is creating and getting together ONLY on secret factories on Ukrain territory.
 	The program has been created for different kinds of special foresees, such as national security, 
 	police, army, especially  for very high-ranking military personnel that have to transferring very 
 	"TOP SECRET" information  and files.  And also can be using for some sort of diplomatic 
 	representatives that have special level of accessory.

The same thins with decryption. The click in "Decrypt" button will activate decryption and decompression 
process, that will also be displayed in progress bar. But, before decryption, the User will have to enter
 the decryption password, that in current situation is his ID's password.

All capabilities that is similar in User's window, such as encryption, decryption and format disk
 here works the same! 
So, we can the administrator rights. Admin can edit Users and flash-drives databases:
